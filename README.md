# Windsurf Calculator
Side-project for fun and practice.

I built this small website with the intention that I would use it myself! It's a basic tool for windsurfers that calculates sail size based on rider weight and windspeed. This kind of tool is not uncommon on the web but all of them are clunky and none of them are mobile friendly. 

Being mobile friendly was a priority for this project as I see this as a tool I would most likely use while out and about. The site needed to be simple, intuitive, fast and have a very small footprint.

Building this site was also a chance to practice some CSS, JS & jQuery techniques I recently learnt. I'm pleased with the outcome although I believe some tweaking is in order to give more accurate estimates.

The calculations will be based on those used by James over at: [James' Blog](http://jimbodouglass.blogspot.co.nz/2010/11/updated-windsurf-calculator-online.html).
